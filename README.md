# Hankotsu ðŸ¦«ðŸ”ªðŸ“ƒ
## What is Hankotsu?
**__Hankotsu__ are Japanese boning knifes with curve blades for meat and joint separation.** This tool strives to separate relevant entries in very large datasets based on substrings on a particular column.\
Dealing with datasets bigger than memory with limited resources is hard and time consuming, Hankotsu provides an alternative for this: **extracting relevant entries to a new file without doing a full copy to memory.**
## Why Go?
I am developing this tool to build the dataset I will use for another project, so time is key.\
Go has a great development experience and I am also way more familiar with it than similar alternatives. It is a very efficient language that will have a (hopefully) quick and fun development.
## Tutorial
### Installation
#### If you already use Go:
1. Download this project and extract all files on a folder.
